Description: The method, termed as targeting coalescent analysis (TCA), computes for all cells of a tissue the average coalescent rate at the monophyletic clades of the target tissue, the inverse of which then measures the progenitor number of the tissue. To achieve a higher computational efficiency, we rewrite the entire package in a more compact way.
